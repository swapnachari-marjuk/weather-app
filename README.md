# Weather Info App

A simple and interactive web application where users can search for any city and instantly view its current weather information.

## 📌 About the Project
This project was built primarily for **DOM manipulation practice**. It utilizes:

- **OpenWeather (OpenAPI) API** for fetching real-time weather data  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for all logic and DOM updates  
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive UI styling  

## 🔍 How It Works
Upon visiting the live site, you will find a search bar.

- If an incorrect city name is entered, an **error message** will appear  
- If the search field is empty, the browser shows its **default alert**

## 🏠 Run Locally

This is a front-end (static) web project, so no backend server is required. Follow these steps to run it on your local machine:

1. **Clone or Download the Project**  
   - From GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-link>
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP and unzip it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**  
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>

3. **Open index.html in Your Browser**
   - Double-click the index.html file.

4. **Optional: Using a Development Server**
   For faster reloads during development, you can use a lightweight dev server:

   - VS Code + Live Server Extension:
      - Open the project in VS Code
      - Open index.html and click the Go Live button at the bottom

### ⚠ Note: Since the project fetches data from the OpenWeather API, ensure your internet
